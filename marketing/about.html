                    Hi there! I'm the person behind Easy Song. Just me, working on this because I'm passionate about language learning and the unique experiences it opens up.
                </p>
                
                <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6 text-lg">
                    Here's the thing: learning a foreign language can open you up to experience unique parts of a culture that you can only get from actually knowing the language and using it in a natural setting. Not forced from workbooks or other memorization techniques. Sure, those have their place—I've used them too. But to truly get to know a language and a culture, you have to immerse yourself in it.
                </p>
                
                <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6 text-lg">
                    And there's no better way to do that than through music.
                </p>
                
                <h2 class="font-display text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6 mt-12">The Problem I Was Trying to Solve</h2>
                <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6 text-lg">
                    I've been learning Spanish for years. I've tried everything—textbooks, apps, tutors, flashcards, you name it. Some of it helped, but nothing really clicked until I started learning through music.
                </p>
                <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6 text-lg">
                    I noticed I could remember song lyrics way better than vocabulary lists. When I listened to Spanish songs, the words stuck. The rhythm helped with pronunciation. The context made the meaning clear. But I couldn't find a tool that combined music videos with synchronized lyrics, translations, and cultural explanations in a way that actually worked for learning.
                </p>
                <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6 text-lg">
                    So I built Easy Song. Not because I wanted to start a company, but because I wanted a tool I would actually use. Something that made learning feel less like studying and more like discovering new music. Something that explained not just what words mean, but why they're used that way, what the slang means, and what cultural context I was missing.
                </p>
                
                <h2 class="font-display text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6 mt-12">Why Music Works</h2>
                <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6 text-lg">
                    Music has this incredible ability to make language stick. You remember lyrics because they're set to a melody. You hear natural pronunciation because you're listening to native speakers. You get cultural context because songs reflect how people actually talk and think. It's learning disguised as entertainment.
                </p>
                <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6 text-lg">
                    But here's the thing—just listening isn't enough. You need to see the lyrics, understand the translations, and get explanations of the nuances. That's where Easy Song comes in. It's the tool I wish I had when I was struggling to make the jump from intermediate to advanced Spanish.
                </p>
                
                <h2 class="font-display text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6 mt-12">What Makes This Different</h2>
                <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6 text-lg">
                    I built Easy Song with a few principles in mind:
                </p>
                <ul class="space-y-4 text-gray-600 mb-6 text-lg">
                    <li class="flex items-start gap-3">
                        <span class="text-indigo-600 font-bold text-xl mt-1">•</span>
                        <span><strong class="text-gray-900">Real songs, not generic content.</strong> You learn with music you'd actually listen to, from artists you might already know.</span>
                    </li>
                    <li class="flex items-start gap-3">
                        <span class="text-indigo-600 font-bold text-xl mt-1">•</span>
                        <span><strong class="text-gray-900">Cultural context, not just translations.</strong> I explain the slang, the idioms, and the cultural nuances that make language come alive. The stuff you can't get from a workbook.</span>
                    </li>
                    <li class="flex items-start gap-3">
                        <span class="text-indigo-600 font-bold text-xl mt-1">•</span>
                        <span><strong class="text-gray-900">Two modes for different learning styles.</strong> Play Along for casual listening, Study Mode for deep dives. Learn your way.</span>
                    </li>
                    <li class="flex items-start gap-3">
                        <span class="text-indigo-600 font-bold text-xl mt-1">•</span>
                        <span><strong class="text-gray-900">Built by a learner, for learners.</strong> Every feature exists because I needed it myself.</span>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                
                <h2 class="font-display text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6 mt-12">Where This Is Going</h2>
                <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6 text-lg">
                    Right now, Easy Song focuses on Spanish, but I'm working on adding more languages. I'm constantly adding new songs to the library and improving the explanations based on feedback from users like you.
                </p>
                <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6 text-lg">
                    This is a side project that I'm passionate about. I'm not trying to build a massive company—I'm trying to build something useful that helps people learn languages in a way that actually works. If Easy Song helps you the way it's helped me, then I've accomplished what I set out to do.
                </p>
                
                <h2 class="font-display text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6 mt-12">Try It Out</h2>
                <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6 text-lg">
                    If you're a language learner who's tried everything and nothing clicked, or if you just love music and want to learn through songs, give Easy Song a try. It's free to download, and I hope it helps you as much as it's helped me.
                </p>
                <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-8 text-lg">
                    And if you have feedback, suggestions, or just want to share your learning journey, I'd love to hear from you. This is a work in progress, and your input makes it better.
                </p>
