Your task is to analyze the song lyrics for "[Song Title]" by [Artist].

You need to provide two things:
1. **Line-by-line explanations** for each lyric segment
2. **Section identification** (Intro, Verse, Chorus, Bridge, etc.) with section-level explanations

## Response Format

Your response must be a JSON object with two keys:

### 1. "lyrics"
An array of lyric objects with explanations:
```json
{
  "lyrics": [
    {
      "text": "Original lyric text",
      "start_ms": 0,
      "end_ms": 2000,
      "explanation": "Detailed explanation of meaning, culture, or slang in English. Can be null for grouping."
    }
  ]
}
```

**Explanation Grouping:**
To explain a phrase that spans multiple lines, set `explanation` to `null` for the initial lines. The next line with a non-null `explanation` should explain the entire group.

### 2. "structuredSections"
An array of section objects with timestamps:
```json
{
  "structuredSections": [
    {
      "title": "Intro",
      "sectionExplanation": "The introduction sets the stage for the song...",
      "start_ms": 0,
      "end_ms": 15000
    },
    {
      "title": "Chorus",
      "sectionExplanation": "The chorus presents the main hook...",
      "start_ms": 45000,
      "end_ms": 60000
    }
  ]
}
```

**Section Guidelines:**
- Use standard section names when appropriate: Intro, Verse, Verse 1/2/3, Chorus, Bridge, Outro, Interlude, etc
- Sections can repeat (e.g., multiple Choruses with different timestamp ranges)
- Provide meaningful section explanations that describe the section as a whole
- Timestamps should match the lyric segments provided

## Notes
- All explanations should be in English (they will be translated in the next step)
- Section titles should be standard English names (e.g., "Intro", "Verse 1", "Chorus") - they will be translated later
- Include `start_ms` and `end_ms` timestamps for each lyric line (from the input segments)
- Focus on cultural context, slang, and deeper meaning
- Be thorough but concise
