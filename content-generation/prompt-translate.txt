# Translation Guidelines

This document contains general guidelines for translating song lyrics and explanations. These guidelines are used when translating into any target language.

## Important Notes

- **Corrected Lyrics**: The lyrics you receive have already been analyzed and corrected for transcription errors. Please use the provided text as-is for translation. Do not modify the lyric text during translation.

- **Meaning and Tone**: Maintain the meaning and tone of the original text. Preserve the emotional impact and stylistic choices.

- **Cultural Context**: Preserve cultural references and context. When translating, consider how cultural elements should be handled (kept as-is, explained, or adapted).

- **Explanations**: For explanations, ensure the translated explanation makes sense in the target language. The explanation should be natural and clear, not a literal word-for-word translation.

- **Null Explanations**: If an explanation was `null` in the input, the translation should also be `null`. This is used for grouping multiple lines that share a single explanation.

## Translation Approach

Translations are done language-by-language:
- Each language is translated in a separate API call
- All lyrics are translated into one target language at a time
- All sections are translated into one target language at a time
- This approach ensures quality and avoids length limits

## Supported Languages

- `en` - English
- `es` - Spanish
- `fr` - French
- `de` - German
- `zh` - Chinese
- `it` - Italian
